# Segment Shopping Customers
- My boss wanted me to identify the most important shopping groups based on income, age, and the mall shopping score.
- He wants the ideal number of groups with a label for each
Problem: 
understanding the target customers for the marketing team to plan a strategy

# Objective Market Segmentation
- Divide the mall target market into approachable groups. Create subsets of a market based on demographics behavioral criteria to better understand the target for marketing activities.

# The Approach
- Perform some quick EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Use KMEANS Clustering algorithms to create our segments 
- Example: Using KMeans unsupervised machine learning algorithm to find the univariate, bivariate, and multivariate clusters.
- Once clusters identified, Use Summary Statistics on the clusters to identify best marketing group
- Data Visualization 

# Tools Used 
- Python
- Jupyter Noterbook
- PowerPoint

# Analysis
Target Cluster
